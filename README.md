# FAANG-Quant-Risk-Model
A quantitative finance project analyzing the risk and performance of a FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) portfolio against the S&P 500. The model uses daily stock price data to compute metrics like monthly returns, standard deviation, Beta, Treynor Ratio, and Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% and 99% confidence levels. Key findings include NFLXâ€™s high return (3.32%) and volatility (12.06%). This project showcases skills in financial modeling, risk management, and data-driven decision-making.
